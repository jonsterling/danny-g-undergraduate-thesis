\section{An ML-like Language with General References}\label{sec:language}

In order to make the discussion of logical relations more concrete, a
particular language is necessary. In this section we develop a core
calculus suitable for studying the effects of general references on
reasoning.

The language under consideration here is heavily influenced by the
Modernized Algol discussed by Harper~\citep{TODO:PFPL}. It features a
syntactic separation between commands and expressions. Expressions are
characterized by being unable to depend on in any way on the
heap. Commands may modify the heap using assignables, a mutable
``variable'' that makes clear the binding structure (nominal rather
than substitutive). A crucial component of the system is a modality
for internalizing and suspending commands to treat them as
expressions. Arguably this language is heavier-weight than the ML-like
languages usually discussed which just allow references in any
location. It does confer that advantage that handling state is now a
question of defining the logical action of the command modality and
its complexity is not littered throughout the full logical
relation. Indeed, the definitions of the logical relation at $\to$ or
$\forall$ are almost completely unchanged.

The syntax of our language has three sorts: commands, expressions, and
types defined by the following grammar.
\[
  \begin{array}{lcl}
    \tau & ::= & \alpha \mid \fn{\tau}{\tau} \mid \allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}
    \mid \cmd{\tau}\\
    c & ::= & \ret{e} \mid \get{\alpha} \mid \set{\alpha}{e} \\
      & \mid & \dcl{\alpha}{e}{c} \mid \bnd{x}{e}{c}\\
    e & ::= & x \mid \ap{e}{e} \mid \lam{x}{\tau}{e} \mid
              \LamNoKind{\alpha}{e} \mid \cmd{e}
  \end{array}
\]
Only one point of this syntax must be clarified, which is the
unfortunate coincidence of $\alpha$s. In an attempt to maintain
consistency with the standard literature on System F and
Harper~\citep{TODO:PFPL} $\alpha$ here refers either to an assignable
(a symbol) or a type variable. Crucially, assignables are \emph{not}
variables. Assignables are bound by the operators of our language and
they do $\alpha$-vary as a variable might but they may not be
substituted for. This justifies comparing bound symbols for equality;
they are placeholders and contain an intrinsic notion of identity in
the form of a binding site. It is nonsensical to talk about a rule
like the following.
\[
  \inferrule{ }{\step{\dcl{\alpha}{v}{c}}{[v/\alpha]c}}
\]
In some sense, this is similar to the confusion that many programmers
have when discussing languages with variables: C-like languages do not
permit substitution because they do not possess variables but rather
assignables. In C a rule like the above is clearly false and leads to
statements such as \verb+1 = 2+. One can understand the difference
between $\bnd{x}{e}{c}$ and $\dcl{x}{e}{c}$ as the difference between
\emph{variables}, defined through substitution, and \emph{assignables}
which are defined through binding identity. The former is like a
let-binding while the latter is closer to a declaration in C. In our
language this separation exists which is why the operators for reading
and writing a mutable cell are indexed by symbol rather than taking an
arbitrary term. There is much to be said on the subject of symbols
and, more generally, nominal binding but it is sadly out-of-scope for
this discussion. The interested reader is referred
to~\citep{TODO-NOMINAL-STUFF}.

The static semantics of the language are divided into three judgments,
the first of which is the judgment ensuring a type is a
well-formed. Informally, a type is well formed in a context $\Delta$
if $\Delta$ contains all the free variables of the type.
\begin{mathpar}
  \declareJudgement{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau}{\tp}}\\
  \inferrule{
    \alpha \in \Delta
  }{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\alpha}{\tp}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau_1}{\tp}\\
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau_2}{\tp}
  }{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\fn{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}{\tp}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta, \alpha}{\tau}{\tp}
  }{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}}{\tp}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau}{\tp}
  }{\hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\cmd{\tau}}{\tp}}
\end{mathpar}
In order to explain the statics of expressions and commands two
judgments are necessary and they must depend on each other. This
mutual dependence is a result of the $\cmd{-}$ modality which
internalizes the command judgment. First the expression judgment is
given, it is completely standard except that it must also be fibered
over a specification of the available assignables. This extra context
is necessary in order to make sense of the binding done in
$\mathsf{dcl}$.
\begin{mathpar}
  \declareJudgement{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}}\\
  \inferrule{
    x : \tau \in \Gamma
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{x}{\tau}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma, x : \tau_1}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau_2}
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\lam{x}{\tau_1}{e}}{\fn{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e_1}{\fn{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}\\
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e_2}{\tau_1}\\
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\ap{e_1}{e_2}}{\tau_2}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta, \alpha}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\LamNoKind{\alpha}{e}}{\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau}}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\allNoKind{\alpha}{\tau_1}}\\
    \hasTJ{}{\Delta}{\tau_2}{\tp}
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\Ap{e}{\tau_2}}{[\tau_2/\alpha]\tau_1}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{m}{\tau}
  }{\hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}}
\end{mathpar}
These are the rules of System F with the exception of the final
one. This makes use of the judgment for commands, where
$\hasM{m}{\tau}$ signifies that $m$ is a command which (when executed
on the appropriate heap) will run to a $\ret{v}$ for some
$\hasE{v}{\tau}$. It is worth noting that $\Sigma$ in this judgment is
unimportant except in this rule as well. It is only necessary to track
the available assignables because without this information it is not
possible to determine if a command is well-typed. The rules for
commands are as follows.
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\ret{e}}{\tau}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \alpha \div \tau \in \Sigma
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\get{\alpha}}{\tau}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \alpha \div \tau \in \Sigma\\
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau}
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\set{\alpha}{e}}{\tau}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\tau_2}\\
    \hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma, \alpha : \tau_2}{m}{\tau_1}
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\dcl{\alpha}{e}{m}}{\tau_1}}\and
  \inferrule{
    \hasESigJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{e}{\cmd{\tau_1}}\\
    \hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma, x : \tau_1}{\Sigma}{m}{\tau_2}
  }{\hasMJ{\Delta}{\Gamma}{\Sigma}{\bnd{x}{e}{m}}{\tau_2}}\and
\end{mathpar}
