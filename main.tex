\title{The Next 700 Failed Step-Index-Free Logical Relations}

\begin{abstract}
  An important question in programming languages is the study of
  program equivalence. This is done typically with the construction of
  a relation denotational model or a syntactic analogue, called a
  logical relation. Logical relations have been shown to be an
  effective tool for analyzing properties and lending formal weight to
  ideas like data abstraction and information hiding. A central
  difficulty with logical relations is their fragility; it has proven
  to be a difficult challenge to scale logical relations to more
  realistic languages. In this thesis, we discuss a number of methods
  for the construction of a logical relation for a language with
  general references. None of these methods are sufficient to
  construct a logical relation without resorting to step-indexing,
  demonstrating the difficulty of expressing the recursive structure
  of higher-order references.

\maketitle

In the study of programming languages a great number of important
questions can be reduced to questions about the equality of
programs. The verification of a compiler pass is nothing but a
question of equality of the naive program and its optimized version,
an optimized data structure may be shown to be correct relative to a
much simpler reference solution, a type theory hinges on the
construction of definitional equality and so on. Given the role that
equality plays in programming languages, a great variety of
mathematical tools have been developed to analyze the various notions
of equality possible in a programming language.

Broadly speaking, there are two classes of these tools. One may
consider denotational approaches, where in the equality of programs is
reduced to the question of the equality of normal mathematical
objects. This line of study begins with Dana Scott's investigations of
the lambda calculus~\citep{TODO-CITE-SCOTT}. These tools have been
immensely effective when they may be applied but they are difficult to
use. Complex programming languages often make use of extremely
sophisticated mathematical objects and using the model requires
understanding them. This has meant that denotational semantics is
traditionally out of reach for the verification of programs by an
average programmer or anyone besides a domain expert.

On the other hand, there are syntactic approaches to equality. Some of
these date back to the original study of the lambda calculus and its
reduction properties. Syntactic tools tend to be simpler to use,
relying only one elementary mathematics and an understanding of the
syntax itself. For equality, the tool of choice when working
syntactically is a logical relation~\citep{TODO-TAIT-AMAL}. Dating
back to~\citet{TODO-TAIT} logical relations crucially define a
type-indexed notion of equality. Logical relations have proven
important for validating certain obviously desirable properties such
as function extensionality. They have also given rise to a powerful
theory of data abstraction called
parametricity~\citep{TODO-REYNOLDS}.
